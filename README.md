# Applied JavaScript Sprint Challenge

**Read these instructions carefully. Understand exactly what is expected _before_ starting this Sprint Challenge.**

This challenge allows you to practice the concepts and techniques learned over the past sprint and apply them in a concrete project. This sprint explored **Applied JavaScript**. During this sprint, you studied **DOM and components**. In your challenge this week, you will demonstrate your mastery of these skills by creating **an online Lambda newspaper called "Lambda Times"**.

This is an individual assessment. All work must be your own. Your challenge score is a measure of your ability to work independently using the material covered through this sprint. You need to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts and objectives introduced and practiced in preceding days.

You are not allowed to collaborate during the sprint challenge. However, you are encouraged to follow the twenty-minute rule and seek support from your TL if you need direction.

_You have **three hours** to complete this challenge. Plan your time accordingly._

## Introduction

You are going to create a Lambda Newspaper. Your job is going to be to create the components that make up the newspaper's home page. You will do this at first with static data, then you will request data from a server to create dynamic components.

In meeting the minimum viable product (MVP) specifications listed below, your project should look like the animation linked below. NOTE that the animation includes one of the stretch goals (the filtering of the articles by clicking on a topic).

### Commits

Commit your code regularly and meaningfully. This helps both you (in case you ever need to return to old code for any number of reasons) and your team lead as the evaluate your solution.

## Interview Questions

Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. You might prepare by writing down your own answers before hand.

1. What is the DOM?

The DOM is the Document Object Model. It is essentially a data representation of the HTML source code that the browser creates. It's key attributes are that it is Tree structure made of parent and child nodes and it is dynamic. The DOM allows developers to interact with the webpage in real time - adding/ removing elements, styles and functionality. 

2. What is an event?

Events are objects that are sent when something takes place on teh web page. For example when a user clicks on a button or hovers over an image a 'click' or 'hover' event objects is sent to notify the code that the event has taken place. Events can be triggered in alot of differnt ways such as CSS Animation, Resource Occurences (load, error, etc) user generated (click, scroll, keydown etc...), CSS Animations, and more. 

3. What is an event listener?

Event Listners are essentially pieces of code teh 'listen' for an event to take place then excute a desired block of code. It could be as straight foreward as populating a email opt in form 10 second after the page loads, or populating new elements when a user selects certain data (like an interactive dashboard).

4. Why would we convert a NodeList into an Array?

Converting a NodeList into an array is useful because you get access to all of Arrays prototype methods. Whereas a NodeLlist is an 'array like object' and only has access to .forEach().

5. What is a component?

A component is a single modular piece of code that is made up of HTML, CSS (preferably from an external style sheet), and Javascript. Javascript is used to construct the Component by building the elements, nesting them appropriatley, assigning classes or Id's in accordance with the desired sytling, populating the HTML content and attributes, and building functionality via event listners. 

You are expected to be able to answer questions in these areas. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Project Set Up

#### Repository Set Up

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project
- [ ] Add your team lead as collaborator on Github
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!)
- [ ] Create a new branch: `git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly
- [ ] Push commits: `git push origin <firstName-lastName>`

#### Launching the App

- [ ] Navigate to the root of the project with your command line
- [ ] Run `npm install` to download the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file
- [ ] Run `npm start` to compile the project and serve it
- [ ] Navigate Chrome to the URL indicated in the output of the `npm start` command

### Task 2: Project Requirements

Your finished project must include all of the following requirements:

- [ ] Look through the HTML code and familiarize yourself with the different sections. Some of them already exist, but some need to be filled in. DO NOT add any code to the `index.html` file itself.

- [ ] Following the instructions in the `components/Header.js` file, create the Header.

- [ ] Following the instructions in the `components/Tabs.js` file, create the Tabs.

- [ ] Following the instructions in the `components/Cards.js` file, create the Cards.

In your solution, it is essential that you follow best practices and produce clean and professional results. You will be scored on your adherence to proper code style and good organization. Schedule time to review, refine, and assess your work and perform basic professional polishing including spell-checking and grammar-checking on your work. It is better to submit a challenge that meets MVP than one that attempts too much and does not.

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

After finishing your required elements, you can push your work further. These goals may or may not be things you have learned in this module but they build on the material you just studied. Time allowing, stretch your limits and see if you can deliver on the following optional goals:

- [ ] Use the tabs at the top of the page to filter articles by topic.
- [ ] Following the instructions in the `components/Carousel.js file`, create the Carousel component.
- [ ] Render an error message on the page for the user, if the network request to fetch articles fails.

## Submission format

Follow these steps for completing your project.

- [ ] Submit a Pull-Request to merge `<firstName-lastName>` Branch into `main` branch (student's  Repo). **Please don't merge your own pull request**
- [ ] Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
- [ ] Your team lead will count the project as complete after receiving your pull-request
